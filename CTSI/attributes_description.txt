	* 0 - not attached 
	* 1 - attached 
	
twinax_capable 
	Whether the IOP is capable of being tagged as the console device for a twinaxial console. This attribute is only shown if iop is 1. This attribute is current only if vpd_stale is 0. The default values is 0 (not capable). 
	
type 
	The type of the underlying device. Possible values follow: 
	* logical - logical device 
	* phys - physical device 
	
unassigned_logical_port_ids 
	List of logical port IDs in the port group that are not assigned to a partition.

user_def_mac_addr 
	User defined MAC address for the logical port. 
	
valid_port_group_mcs_values 
	Valid MCS values. 
	
virtual_opti_pool_id

vpd_type 
	Type of the I/O adapter. 
	
wwpns 
	If the adapter is of type client, the worldwide port names assigned to this adapter are displayed as a comma-separated list. If the adapter is of type server, by default, the attribute is not displayed. If the attribute is requested, the value is null. 
	
wwpn_prefix 
	A 12-character hexadecimal string that is used by the managed system to generate worldwide port names. 
	--header Display a header record, which is a delimiter separated list of attribute names for the attribute values that will be displayed. This header record will be the first record displayed. This option is only valid when used with the - F option. 
	-R List information for partitions with resources that can be restored due to a dynamic LPAR operation failure.
